# Playwright acceptance tests

These tests start a temporary Shopware shop, install this plugin revision, take a guest through checkout in PAY. test mode, and check that the Shopware transaction becomes **paid**. No live money is moved.

## GitHub Actions

1. In the GitHub repository, open **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

   | Secret | Purpose |
   | --- | --- |
   | `PAY_TOKEN_CODE` | Token code (`AT-xxxx-xxxx`) |
   | `PAY_API_TOKEN` | API token |
   | `PAY_SERVICE_ID` | Sales location (`SL-xxxx-xxxx`) |
   | `PAY_SANDBOX_SECRET` | Sales-location secret from my.pay.nl (Settings → Sales location). Typed into the PAY. sandbox. This is not the API token. |
   | `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` | Optional. When set, the workflow uses ngrok for the public HTTPS callback URL. Otherwise it uses a Cloudflare quick tunnel. |

   Use a PAY. **test** sales location, not a live one.

2. Open **Actions → Playwright PAY. checkout → Run workflow**.
3. Choose the plugin branch, tag, or SHA to test. Optionally override the Shopware version (default `6.7.10.0`).
4. Each run creates a fresh Shopware container, installs that revision, and tears the shop down afterwards.
5. The HTML report, failure screenshots, traces, videos, and Shopware logs are uploaded as the `playwright-pay-checkout` artifact, including on failure.

The shop is published on a public HTTPS URL for the duration of the run so PAY. can send payment notifications to `/PaynlPayment/notify`.

## Local

Requirements: Docker, Node.js 24+, and either [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download). Node 24 is required by `@shopware-ag/acceptance-test-suite`.

```bash
cd tests/Acceptance
cp .env.example .env
# Fill PAY_TOKEN_CODE, PAY_API_TOKEN, PAY_SERVICE_ID, and PAY_SANDBOX_SECRET (sales-location secret, not the API token).
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm run env:up
npm test
npm run env:down
```

`env:up` starts Shopware `6.7.10.0`, opens a public HTTPS tunnel, **installs and activates PaynlPaymentShopware6**, writes PAY. test-mode config, and installs the uniform **Pay by PAY.** method.

Playwright also runs that plugin install before the tests (`npm run env:plugin`). If you already have Shopware running:

```bash
npm run env:plugin
npm test
```

To use an existing shop instead of `env:up`, set `APP_URL` (public HTTPS, trailing slash) and `ADMIN_API_URL` in `.env`, install the plugin yourself, enable test mode, and install payment methods. PAY. still needs that public HTTPS callback URL.

Open the last HTML report with `npm run report` (port 9324). If that port is busy, use `npx playwright show-report --port 9325`.
